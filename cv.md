I am a man of a different interests. Solving interesting tasks and challenges is my life moto. If I'm on to something - I'll do my best to finish it. Even though I don't have a lot of expereince in codding, my university gives me a great opportunity to study different programming languages and practice them in my free time. I belive that with time and right guidence I'll be able to work well in IT industry.

**Skills:** Have been using C++, Java. A little HTML and CSS.The only skill measure I have is a mark in my student book, unfortunatly. Also some time ago I finished HTML course on codeacademy ([my account on codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/UncleTolic)).

I am studying in BSU on Radiophysics faculty (*aerospace department*). As I already told completed HTML course on codeacademy.

I've been studying English since first grade of my school. Now I'm working more on my vocabulary, mostly by reading bofiction books and educational literature.
